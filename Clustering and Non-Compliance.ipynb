    "#### Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of experimental design, clustering refers to a method used to group experimental units or subjects into homogeneous subsets based on certain characteristics or attributes. The goal of clustering is to create groups that are internally similar and externally dissimilar. By clustering similar units together, researchers can reduce variability within each group and increase the efficiency of experiments. This allows for more precise comparisons and analysis of treatment effects. Clustering in experimental design helps to create a balanced and representative sample of the population under study.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Context and Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset pertains to a hypothetical Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) for application of a technique called \"clustered randomization.\" In this scenario, there are a total of 200 stores within a company. These stores were randomly assigned into two groups: 100 treatment stores and 100 control stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the treatment group, pictures of individuals using the products sold in the store were displayed as in-store advertisements. The objective of the study is to examine whether these in-store advertisements have an impact on the amount of purchases made by customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gather the necessary information, data was collected from the first 1,000 individuals who entered the stores after the launch of the experiment. For each of these 1,000 people, the amount they purchased at the store was recorded."

    "#### Non-Compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-compliance, in the context of experimental design, refers to situations where participants or subjects do not adhere to the assigned treatment or fail to comply with the experimental protocol. Non-compliance can occur for various reasons, such as unwillingness to follow instructions, technical issues, or external factors influencing participant behavior. Non-compliance can introduce bias and impact the validity of experimental results. Researchers often employ strategies to address non-compliance, such as monitoring and tracking participant adherence, implementing incentives or reminders, or analyzing the data using intention-to-treat or complier average causal effect approaches. These approaches help to account for non-compliance and mitigate its potential effects on the experimental findings.\n",

The standard practice at the company has been to put up flyers about the on-site clinic days and send a mass-email to the company encouraging everyone to get the flu shot.  This year the company ran an Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to test a new program to try to increase the fraction of employees getting the shot. They had two treatment groups:\n",

    "- Treatment 2: Was the same as Treatment 1.  However, after 1 week if the employee had not taken the online quiz, they got a short automated call to their work phone number to highlight it to them.   \n",
