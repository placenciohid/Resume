    "### Section 1: Sudoku Solver using Integer Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sudoku puzzle is a classic 9x9 grid-based puzzle where the goal is to fill each cell with a number from 1 to 9 such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each **row** contains all numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once.\n",
    "2. Each **column** contains all numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once.\n",
    "3. Each **3x3 sub-grid** (blocks within the main 9x9 grid) also contains all numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, this problem can be represented using a set of constraints over a binary variable `x[i, j, k]`, where `i` and `j` represent the cell position in the grid, and `k` represents a candidate number. If `x[i, j, k] = 1`, it means that the cell `(i, j)` contains the number `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Constraint Definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single Number per Cell**: Ensure that each cell contains exactly one number.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$ \\sum_{k=1}^{9} x[i, j, k] = 1, \\, \\forall \\, i, j $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Row and Column Constraints**: Each number must appear exactly once in each row and each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ \\sum_{j=1}^{9} x[i, j, k] = 1, \\, \\forall \\, i, k $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$ \\sum_{i=1}^{9} x[i, j, k] = 1, \\, \\forall \\, j, k $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sub-grid Constraints**: Each number must appear exactly once in each 3x3 sub-grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ \\sum_{i', j' \\in \\, \\text{block}(i, j)} x[i', j', k] = 1, \\, \\forall \\, k $$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Objective Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the standard Sudoku problem, we are primarily interested in finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the objective function can be set to a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in this **Sudoku** variation, the objective is to maximize the sum of elements on the main diagonal of the grid. This adds an extra layer of complexity, requiring custom constraints to prioritize certain cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code implements a Sudoku solver in Julia using the `JuMP` library and the `HiGHS` solver. The solver not only satisfies the Sudoku constraints but also solves a modified version of the puzzle, where the sum of the diagonal elements is maximized."
